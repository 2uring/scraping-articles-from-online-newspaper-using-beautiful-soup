# scraping-articles-from-online-newspaper-using-beautiful-soup

Web Crawler to count no. of articles with a particular given word in The Hindu published in 2010.

This project scrapes through all the articles published in 2010 in The Hindu news paper and returns the number of the articles which have a particular word specified by the user.

Install BeautifulSoup4 and the python requests module before running the code.
The only other dependency the code has is the regular expressions(re) module, which requirement will be mostly satisfied by the version of python you are using. If not, install it separately.

It is preferred you run  the jupyter notebook.
Both .ipynb and .py files are there in the repo.
